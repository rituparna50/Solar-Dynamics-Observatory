# Solar-Dynamics-Observatory
Telemetry Analysis of SDO by using JPL Ephemeris. 

**About SDO**
The Solar Dynamics Observatory is the first mission to be launched for NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) Program, a program designed to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. SDO is designed to help us understand the Sun's influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously.



The JPL Horizons System allows access to solar system data of ephemerides to observers and sceintists and gheneral public, mission  planners etc.
