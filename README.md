# Solar-Dynamics-Observatory
Telemetry Analysis of SDO by using JPL Ephemeris. 

**About SDO**
The Solar Dynamics Observatory is the first mission to be launched for NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) Program, a program designed to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. SDO is designed to help us understand the Sun's influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously.

SDO's main mission is to have a predictive ability to understand solar variations and its effects on earth. 
- How the sun's magnetic field is fored and structured
- How this stored magnetic energy is converted and released into the heliosphere as well as geospace in the form of solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance, which ultimately affect space weather.

*Instruments*
****Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
****EUV Variability Experiment (EVE)
****Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)

The JPL Horizons System allows access to solar system data of ephemerides to observers and sceintists and gheneral public, mission  planners etc.
