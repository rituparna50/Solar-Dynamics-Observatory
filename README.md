Telemetry Analysis of SDO by using JPL Ephemeris. 

*About SDO*
The Solar Dynamics Observatory is the first mission to be launched for NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) Program, a program designed to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. SDO is designed to help us understand the Sun's influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously.

SDO's main mission is to have a predictive ability to understand solar variations and its effects on earth. 
- How the sun's magnetic field is fored and structured
- How this stored magnetic energy is converted and released into the heliosphere as well as geospace in the form of solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance, which ultimately affect space weather.

*Instruments*
- Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
- EUV Variability Experiment (EVE)
- Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)

*Satellite Specifications*
SDO is on a geo-synchronous orbit, facing the Sun (Sun-pointing), semni-autonomous satellite, that has a continuous Science download datalink capability of 130 Megabits per second (MBPS). Due to the requirement of a high cadence and almost continous Solar observations, the SDO was planted on an inclined geosynchronous orbit. This also lets SDO be in contact with a single ground station. 
- "Nearly continuous observations of the Sun can be obtained from other orbits, such as low Earth orbit (LEO). If SDO were placed into an LEO it would be necessary to store large volumes of scientific data onboard until a downlink opportunity. The large data rate of SDO, along with the difficulties in managing a large on-board storage system, resulted in a requirement of continuous contact." - SDO Webpage-  https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/project.php
- Because SDO is placed at the farthermost end of the radiation belt, there was significant amount of radiation shielding placed on both the instrument as well as electronics. 





The JPL Horizons System allows access to solar system data of ephemerides to observers and sceintists and gheneral public, mission  planners etc.
